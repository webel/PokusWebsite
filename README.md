See Pokus [homepage](https://webel.github.io/PokusWebsite) for a description of _what Pokus is_.

~~**Homepage currently unavailable (scroll down for app demo and description)**, it used to be hosted over at digitalocean before I understood the absurdity of hosting a static page on a droplet (lol).~~

**It is available!** Right here, on github pages! What a breeze, btw, to host a static page here.

Checkout `thePorting.md` for a rundown of how I got the website running again with the `Pokus` repo as a starting point.

I wrote this over on the Pokus repo a couple of days ago;

> I am, as of today (15th of May 2020), adding the homepage here so that potential employers can see that I've actually coded something. Even if it's a cast together prototype I did several years ago, I hope with this repo to showcase how far I've come in those years (honestly, it's a bloody mess opening this can of worms up, which is understandable â€“ it was my first React project, and I did it in under 4 days).

I didn't really manage to do that; provide something for potential employers (the underlying problem is the code not being clean, e.g. two different CSS systems are used), but I believe `thePorting.md` underlies my thinking and the "trouble" I went through (it was actually a lot of fun, reading under the heading "Thoughts and loose ends" gives a general idea of what I stumbled on.)

## [Demo](https://webel.github.io/Pokus)

See Pokus demo [here](https://webel.github.io/Pokus).

This demo is a simple react app that gives an idea of what the Pokus app connected to several devices would look like when used in an open office enviroment, or really any team enviroment where concentration is valued.

### Using the virtual Pokus device

**Start/Stop** the Pokus device by pressing the big gray button in the middle!

**Update timer** by clicking on the timer and entering the number of minutes you would like to focus. Pokus will automatically set your rest time to a fifth of your focus time - as recommended by the pomodoro technique. _Note_ that the device can't be running to update the timer.

**See user panel** by dubbel-clicking anywhere on the background, the userpanel to the right of the device will become visible. On mobile, simply scroll past the virutal device to see the panel.

**See time left for user** by hovering over a users logo.
